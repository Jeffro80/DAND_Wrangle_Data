An image_predictions file in TSV format was downloaded using the requests library and loaded into a pandas dataframe. Additional data that was absent from the enhanced Twitter archive was accessed using the Twitter API. This involved using the Tweepy library within python to store the data from each tweet in a JSON file. This data was then read into a pandas dataframe."

This included looking for obvious incorrect data and to understand what sort of data should be present. It also allowed me to view the structure of the tables and assess tidiness.\n",
